      <h2>Debut day for Mexico and it's against the one and only.... Germany</h2>
      <img src="img/mexger.jpeg" alt="Mexico vs Germany banner">
      <p>This match has been anticipated for so long but most of the World has been expecting Germany to wipe Mexico out. Regardless of what the score
        will be, it is surely one of the most anticipated matches.

      <h2>Game day 2 for Mexico. This match will be against the underdogs South Korea</h3>
      <img src="img/mexvsouthkorea.jpeg" alt="Mexico vs South Korea banner">
      <p>This is talked about as being the easiest match for Mexico in this tournament. South Korea come from losing 1-0 
        against the Swedish so they'll surely be hungry for a victory.

      <h2>Final game of the group stage for Mexico against Sweden
      </h2>
      <img src="img/Mexico-vs-Sweden.jpg" alt="Mexico vs Sweden banner">
      <p>Mexico come in the match as favorites to win the group against the Swedish
          who have also had a great start to the tournament. Nevertheless, Mexico can still be shockingly knocked out of 
        the tournament with a loss tonight and a win by Germany
      </p>

      <figcaption>Another shocking result! The Swedish beat Mexico 3-0 but this wasn't the biggest surprise of the day! The 
        world champions take another defeat but this time against South Korea. Mexico literally gets saved.
